        <p>J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web

            My entire internet experience has been at the hands of a corporation. I made a project last spring that was designed to make the internet more consumer friendly. I looked at my earlier memories on the internet, and particularly my early experiences on YouTube. In the mid 2000’s, Youtube wasn’t algorithm dependent. You largely had to manually type in what you were looking for or look at statistic-based ranking pages to see what other people were watching. YouTube videos were predominantly uploaded by regular people who wanted to create something. I have little conception of what the internet pre-YouTube even felt like. I was born at the dawn of the internet commercialization era. It’s difficult, even as someone who has experienced an earlier internet, to conceive a digital world that’s experience isn’t tethered to a big name hub.  
            Debilitating people, limiting choice. If you want to make and upload videos, you have little choice but to use YouTube if you want to actually reach anyone.
            While Youtube was once a healthier place, it has always exploited the voices and talents of everyday people.
            It’s now more evident than ever the power that platforms like Youtube, who claim to be harborers of self-expression, have. Huge one-stop shop websites like YouTube are attractive because they’re familiar and it minimizes effort on the consumer's end.
