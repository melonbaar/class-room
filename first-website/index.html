    <p>The <a href="https://handade-web.net">hand</a> has become <i>increasingly less present in the web as we know it today.</i> Websites are automated or built
        from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a website is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten
        easier to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a website have become so
        convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. </p>

        This course seeks to dispel these ideas and will emphasize
        the <span class="cool">hand-quality</span> of websites by <b>developing</b> an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and
        present context of the web. We will examine the <small>space</small> of the web at large and explore and challenge what a
        website is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important creative space.</p>
